## Pig Latin Translation Rules:
• If the word starts with a vowel, just add ‘way’ to the end of the word. For example,
o ‘are’ becomes ‘areway’
o ‘in’ becomes ‘inway’
• If the word starts with a consonant, move all of the consonants that appear before the 
first vowel to the end of the word, and then add ‘ay’ to the end of the word. For 
Example,
o ‘word’ becomes ‘ordway’ (‘ord’ + ‘w’+ ‘ay’)
o ‘student’ becomes ‘udentstay’ (‘udent’ + ‘st’ + ‘ay’)
o ‘road’ becomes ‘oadray’ (‘oad’ + ‘r’ + ‘ay’)
